 *	This pattern is behavioral design pattern and it is about Publisher and Subscriber. One to Many relationship or
 *  dependency is defined between the objects.
 *   
 *  This pattern helps us moving to Push Architecture from Poll Architecture. Publisher will notify
 *  all the subscribers at once when the state of publisher changes.
 *  
 *  So whenever there is an update in the behavior or state, all the subscribers will be notified.
